### Diagram details

1. Actors  
    For this project we defined 2 actors:  
    1. Developer – this actor represents the user of the system, typically a developer. The developer interacts with the application by defining and managing protocol elements.  
    2. System – this is the backend of the application. It receives requests from the developer and performs internal operations such as validation, analysis, and generating suggestions.

2. Usecases  
    In the following steps it will be explained the usecases:  
    1. Add element – this use case allows the developer to insert new data into the DBC (Database CAN) configuration.  
    2. Remove element – this use case allows the developer to delete an existing element from the network configuration.  
    3. Upload file – this use case allows the developer to start configuring a network from a predefined DBC file that is uploaded.  
    4. Read/Parse file – this use case is performed by the system and is triggered after the file upload. It parses the content of the DBC file and inserts the extracted protocol elements into the interface. This use case is connected to the next one.  
    5. Validate CAN model – this functionality receives the parsed data and verifies if the file format is correct and if the data does not contain any errors.  
    6. Save file – this use case is shared by both actors. The developer sends a request to save the file, and the system generates a new DBC file based on the current configuration.  
    7. Analysis – this functionality is performed by the system. It analyzes the protocol elements and checks for optimization opportunities.  
    8. Offer suggestions – this use case is connected to the previous one and provides the suggestions found during the analysis.  
    9. Select option – this use case allows the developer to choose one of the suggestions offered by the system.
