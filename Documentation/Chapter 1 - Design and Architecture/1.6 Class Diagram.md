## 1.6 Class Diagram

The following diagram and class descriptions present the internal model used to represent and manipulate CAN DBC files in the system's memory.

---

### 1. ClientConnection
- Handles the client's interaction with the CAN database and processing flow.
- **Key methods:**
  - `connect()`
  - `uploadDBC()`
  - `configureNetwork()`
  - `createNode()`, `createMessage()`, `createSignal()`
  - `offerSuggestion()`, `acceptSuggestion()`, `rejectSuggestion()`
  - `saveModification()`, `closeConnection()`

---

### 2. CANModel
- Central class representing the DBC data structure.
- **Attributes:**
  - `network_nodes: List[NetworkNode]`
  - `messages: List[Message]`
  - `signals: List[Signal]`
  - `value_tables: List[ValueTable]`
- Defines the relationships between messages, nodes, and signals.

---

### 3. NetworkNode
- Represents a physical or logical node in the CAN network.
- **Attributes:**
  - `name: string`
  - `comment: string`
  - `rx_messages`, `tx_messages`: List of messages received/transmitted
  - `attributes`: List of associated attributes
  - `baudrate: int`

---

### 4. Message
- Represents a CAN message frame.
- **Attributes:**
  - `id: int`
  - `name: string`
  - `length: int`
  - `transmitter: NetworkNode`
  - `signals: List[Signal]`
  - `attributes: List[Attribute]`

---

### 5. Signal
- A signal within a message, corresponding to a specific bit range.
- **Attributes:**
  - `name`, `type`, `unit`, `initial`, `minimum`, `maximum`, etc.
  - `value_table: Optional[ValueTable]`
  - `receivers: List[NetworkNode]`
  - `attributes: List[Attribute]`

---

### 6. Attribute
- Metadata attached to any entity like nodes, messages, or signals.
- **Attributes:**
  - `name`, `data_type`, `value`, `comment`
  - `value_type`: string
  - `minimum`, `maximum`: typed object values

---

### 7. ValueTable
- Defines enumerated values for signal interpretation.
- **Attributes:**
  - `name: string`
  - `values: Dict[int, string]`
  - `comment: string`

---

### 8. StatusFunction
- Represents possible status value macros for signals.
- Examples:
  - `AVL = "AVL"`
  - `AVL_A = "AVL_A"`
  - `AVL_C = "AVL_C"`

---

## Managers / Helpers

### CANModelOperations
- Offers methods to add/edit/remove components within a `CANModel`.
- **Notable methods:**
  - `addMessage()`, `addSignal()`, `addNode()`
  - `removeSignal()`, `removeMessage()`
  - `getMessagesForNode()`
  - `getSignalsInMessage()`
  - `serialize()`, `deserialize()`

### CANModelHandler
- Entry point for performing operations on the `CANModel`.
- Manages an instance of `CANModelOperations`.
- Called by the `ClientConnection` layer.

### `SignalAnalyzer`, `MessageAnalyzer`
- Analytical classes that inspect signals and messages to offer suggestions or identify configuration issues.

---

## Purpose

This architecture is designed to:
- Fully represent the DBC schema in memory.
- Allow parsing and regeneration of DBC files.
- Support interactive or programmatic modifications.
- Enable developer-assisted validation and extension of a CAN network.

## Design Principles

This architecture demonstrates adherence to key object-oriented design principles, particularly the SOLID principles and the concept of loose coupling.

### SOLID Principles

- **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**  
  Each class in the architecture is responsible for a single aspect of CAN model processing:
  - `Signal`, `Message`, `NetworkNode` etc. encapsulate only their own data.
  - `CANModelOperations` handles modification logic.
  - `SignalAnalyzer` and `MessageAnalyzer` are dedicated to analysis logic.

- **Open/Closed Principle (OCP)**  
  Classes like `CANModelHandler` and `CANModelOperations` are open for extension (e.g., adding new operations or validation rules) but closed for modification. New features can be introduced without altering existing core logic.

- **Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)**  
  Data types (such as message and signal lists) use consistent interfaces and structures that ensure compatibility and substitutability in algorithms and processes.

- **Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)**  
  Operations are grouped logically in separate classes (`Analyzer`, `Operations`, `Handler`), avoiding large interfaces that force classes to implement unrelated methods.

- **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)**  
  High-level modules (e.g., `ClientConnection`) do not depend on low-level implementation classes but instead interact through handler or service layers (`CANModelHandler`, `CANModelOperations`), allowing for flexibility and testability.

---

### Loose Coupling

The system is designed with **loose coupling** in mind:
- Entities like `Signal`, `Message`, and `NetworkNode` interact through well-defined relationships but are not tightly dependent on one anotherâ€™s internal implementations.
- Business logic is separated from data representation.
- Analysis and suggestion logic (`SignalAnalyzer`, `MessageAnalyzer`) are separated from the core model and can be modified or replaced independently.

This design enables scalability, maintainability, and ease of testing while minimizing the risk of unintended side effects when making changes to individual components.
