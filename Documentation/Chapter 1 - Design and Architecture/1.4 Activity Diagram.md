## 1.4 Activity Diagram

The activity diagram presented above illustrates the flow of logic in the CAN network configuration process. It is structured in multiple parallel flows, each color-coded for clarity and modularity. Each color corresponds to a specific functional area of the application.

### Green: Overview Activity

The green flow represents the high-level overview of the entire process. It defines the main steps required to configure the CAN network:

- Configure network
- Create network node
- Create signal
- Create message
- Configure network layout
- Create attribute

This is the parent diagram from which each of the colored sub-processes branches off.

### Blue: Create Network Node

This sub-process focuses on defining a network node. It includes:

- Naming the network node
- Setting its address
- Selecting the node type
- Optionally writing a comment

---

### Brown: Create Signal

This flow describes the steps needed to define a signal:

- Set signal name
- Link a value table (if needed)
- Set scale parameters: factor, offset, number of bits, byte order
- Define minimum and maximum values
- Optionally enable safety functionality
- The system may offer suggestions (e.g., for signal size optimization)
- The user can accept suggestions or manually update signal parameters
- Optionally add a comment

---

### Dark Green: Create Message

The message creation process involves the following:

- Name the message
- Define message ID and DLC
- Add one or more signals to the message
- Analyze and organize signal positions
- The system may offer placement suggestions
- The user can accept or reject the suggestions
- Update the message configuration
- Optionally write a comment

---

### Gray-Blue: Configure Network Node

This step allows users to configure transmission behavior for each node:

- Set baudrate
- Assign RX signals
- Assign TX messages
- Select the related network

---

### Red: Create Attribute

This process covers the definition of an attribute associated with other objects:

- Set attribute name
- Specify the object type it applies to (e.g., message, signal)
- Define the value type (e.g., int, float, string)
- Set a default value
- Define minimum and maximum values
- Optionally write a comment

---

### Optional Features (White Elements)

The diagram also includes elements marked in **white**, such as `Suggestions`, `Select a suggestion`, and `Update message`. These represent **nice-to-have features**.

If these features are not implemented on time, they will be removed from the final diagram, without affecting the core functionality of the application.
