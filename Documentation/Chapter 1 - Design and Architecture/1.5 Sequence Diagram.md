## 1.5 Sequence Diagram

The following image illustrates the step-by-step interaction between the **Web API**, the **Client Connection**, and the **Developer** during the setup and configuration of a communication network using DBC files.

### Participants

- **Web API** – Initiates the connection request and communicates with the client.
- **Client Connection** – Handles the core operations such as uploading, configuring, and modifying the network.
- **Developer** – Interacts with the system for validation and handling of automated suggestions.

---

### Sequence of Operations

The sequence below outlines the typical flow of actions during a session:

#### 1. Connection Initialization
- The **Web API** sends a connection request to start the session.
- A **Client Connection** is established to manage all subsequent interactions.

---

#### 2. DBC Upload and Validation
- If a predefined `.dbc` file is available, it is uploaded by the client.
- The file undergoes validation:
  - If errors are detected, the **Developer** is notified to take action.

---

#### 3. Network Configuration
- Upon successful validation:
  - The system configures the network.
  - A **network node** and a **signal** are created within the network.

---

#### 4. Signal-Level Suggestions
- If the system generates suggestions for a signal:
  - They are presented to the **Developer**.
  - The developer can:
    - Accept the suggestion → the DBC file is updated.
    - Reject the suggestion → it is ignored.

---

#### 5. Message Creation
- A new **message** is created based on the current network configuration.

---

#### 6. Message-Level Suggestions
- If there are suggestions related to the message:
  - They are presented to the developer.
  - The developer decides to:
    - Accept → update the DBC.
    - Reject → discard the suggestion.

---

#### 7. Additional Node Configuration
- The system may apply additional configuration to the network node, if required.

---

#### 8. Attribute Handling
- If attributes are needed to complete the setup:
  - The system generates and assigns the appropriate attributes.

---

#### 9. Finalization
- All modifications are saved to persistent storage.
- The connection is closed gracefully.
