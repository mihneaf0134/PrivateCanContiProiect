## 1.1 Techincal Apects

The application is build using a monolitic architecture, centred arrount a Web API. It si developed with the Flask framework in Python. 

In this monolithic architecture, all core functionalities (API handling, protocol configuration, and optimization logic) are integrated into a single deployable unit. This approach it was chosen due to the relatively limited scope of the application and advantages it brings in terms of simplicity, faster development, and easier deployment. But because it this application it is just an example, the cost factor it was not considered.

All components reside within a single codebase, sharing the same runtime context. This allows for fast data exchange between modules and simplified error handling, at the cost of reduced modularity compared to microservices.

The application follows a layered design and applies SOLID principles to ensure a clear separation of concerns between API handling, business logic, and data modeling.

At the core of the system lies the data model layer, which includes classes such as CANModel, Node, Message, Signal, ValueTable, and Status_Function. These classes define the structure of a CAN network and encapsulate domain-specific entities like message frames, signal definitions, and node configurations. This layer is focused exclusively on representing configuration data, ensuring high cohesion and independence from logic and I/O concerns.

The business logic layer builds on top of the model and includes components such as CANAnalyzer, SignalAnalyzer, MessageAnalyzer, and CANOperations. These components implement the application's core functionality â€” parsing the configuration, analyzing it for inefficiencies, and generating optimization suggestions. Each analyzer focuses on a specific type of element (e.g., signals, messages), aligning with the Single Responsibility Principle. The logic is modular and loosely coupled, making the system easier to maintain and extend.

At the top, the API layer is represented by the ClientConnection class, which exposes the application's capabilities via a RESTful interface built with Flask. This layer handles HTTP requests and responses and is responsible for interacting with client applications (e.g., graphical UIs or developer tools). It exchanges data in JSON format, both for configuration input and for returning suggestions, error messages, or results. This format was chosen for its readability, flexibility, and compatibility with most front-end and scripting environments.

By adhering to a layered design, the API layer does not contain business logic; instead, it acts as a bridge, delegating requests to the business logic layer and returning structured JSON responses. This approach supports both clarity and maintainability, following principles like Open/Closed, Interface Segregation, and Dependency Inversion.

The choice of Flask was motivated by its lightweight and flexible nature, making it ideal for building clean and fast REST APIs. Flask allows for quick endpoint definition, clean routing, and seamless integration with JSON-based communication, which aligns perfectly with the monolithic architecture and the tool-oriented focus of the application.
